# HarvardX
These are my working solutions for the proposed course projects: "CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python" ([`Harvard`](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python?delta=0) or [`edx`](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home)).

For simplicity, I also attach an excerpt of the text of the various projects in the various internal README.md

The other solutions will be coming soon!
